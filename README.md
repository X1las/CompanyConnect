Short code that reads and converts a JSON dict to a series of weighted connections to calculate ownership.

How To:

- Change parameters within for loop of main.py at line 60 and below where stated to search relationship between two companies from the dictionary
- Parameters can be either a string ID or the string Name of a company (note, it will not work with danish letters)
- Run main.py within the project folder, and watch as it calculates ownership between two companies
